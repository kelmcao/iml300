    <div class="formatted-text present-a"><p>You leave home, taking a different route than usual because of some traffic blockade or protest, you're not sure. You walk
down
       a
           winding
                    alleyway.
                             and pass
                                     by a gaggle of men.
                                                  You look down, ignoring them.

                                                <span style="font-size:30px;">
                                                    Keep your head down. 
                                                    Don't look.
                                                   </span>
                                                   

You continue walking, when suddenly you hear a boom not too far away. People screaming. You start walking faster. Then <a href="explosion-work.html">running.</a></p></div>
