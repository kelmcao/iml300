            You've been taken to a facility somewhere in the Americas, is all you know.
            One day passes, you think it's a nightmare.
            A week passes, and the harsh reality starts to settle in.
            You get interrogated, but when you disagree, they only continue.
            <span style="font-size: 30px;">Weeks continue to fly by,   one   after the   other   , turning into
                months.</span>
            <span style="font-size: 50px;">Months turn into a year. Your life falls into a monotony, </span>
            <span style="font-size: 70px;">It's been five years since you've seen your loved ones.
                You wonder if you'll be here
                forever.
            </span>
