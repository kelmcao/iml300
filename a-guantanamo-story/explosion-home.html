        The blast frightens you. You’re paralysed, unmoving.
        This only happens for a moment, but it feels like an eternity.
        You wonder if your brother's okay. To your relief he comes home early from work. He's fine.


        Your mom hugs him, asks if he got hit by any loose shrapnel, but he just chuckles and shrugs it off.
        You're happy you have such a loving family.
