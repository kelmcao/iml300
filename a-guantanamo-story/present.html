      <h2>AN UNCERTAIN PRESENT</h2>
      <p>
         Given the questionable nature of Guantánamo Bay, from its usage pre-9/11 to present day, the extremely recent
         expansion of the Bay's Migrant Operations Center (GITMO) to 30,000 people should sound alarming. Time and time
         again, record has shown that
         Guantanámo Bay is lacking in resources, and proper treatment, and legal rights/counsel towards its
         detainees.<br>In 2025, a coalition of immigrant-rights organizations, including American Civil Liberties Union
         (ACLU), Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR),
         and International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), filed lawsuits arguing that the U.S. government's transfer
         of migrants from the United States to Guantánamo Bay lacks statutory authority and violates due-process
         protections.
         In one of these suits ( March 2025), they contended that migrants held at Guantánamo are being treated under
         “inhumane and degrading” conditions. These include prolonged isolation, invasive strip searches, physical
         threats, deprivation of water,
         and denial of meaningful access to counsel or family. Moreover, the groups argue that housing migrants offshore
         at a remote, historically secretive military facility, when the U.S. already has ample detention capacity
         onshore, is arbitrary and undermines
         transparency and accountability<a
            href="https://www.acludc.org/press-releases/groups-sue-trump-administration-halt-transfer-immigrants-us-guantanamo-bay-2025/">(ACLU
            Link)</a>.

         <br><Br>Human-rights organizations have supported many of these allegations. For instance, Human Rights Watch
         (HRW) reported on interviews with Venezuelan immigrants previously held at Guantánamo.
         They described being held incommunicado in unsanitary conditions, unaware of their legal status, and unable to
         contact family or legal counsel. <a
            href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/08/29/us-migrants-face-abuse-in-guantanamo">(Human Rights Watch)</a>.
         In February 2025, 177 Venezuelan migrants detained at Guantánamo were flown via Honduras to Venezuela with
         little to no notice towards the public or legal representatives. The Department of Homeland Security
         argued that "recent detainees at Guantanamo do not have a right to legal counsel because they all are subject
         to final orders of removal to Venezuela, affording them "very limited due process rights."" <a
            href="https://apnews.com/article/immigrant-detention-guantanamo-bay-venezeulans-4436c97d8369d663ede98781fd880401">(Associated
            Press)</a>.
         These developments expose a pattern of unlawful detention, lack of due process, degrading treatment, and
         institutional use of secrecy to avoid oversight, all amounting to a systemic violation
         of migrants' fundamental human rights.
