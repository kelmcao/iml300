When it happens, you don’t expect it.

It’s another day, another morning. You’re resting at home, when suddenly, military officers knock down your front door. Your father holds your mother close, keeping her safe. He grabs you and your brother, and pulls you into the huddle.

The soldiers surround you.
They swarm your house.
Search your belongings.

You protest, but that seems only to fuel their anger.

The soldiers are your own, yet instead of protecting you, they’re destroying your house for reasons you don’t even understand.

You want to ask them what’s going on, but something tells you they won’t answer.



Finally, they turn to your brother, and tell him to come with them. He's told that a neighbor reported him as a member of a heinous organization.
He can't say anything to defend himself, and no matter what say to the officers, they refuse to release him.
He tells you not to worry, and just like that, he's <a href="conclusion-home.html">gone.</a>
