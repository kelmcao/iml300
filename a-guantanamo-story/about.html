      <h2>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h2>
      <p>Kelly Cao <br><br> I wanted to create a project building upon the narrative work I had begun doing in Project 2, and combine it with a historical site that
        still carries a lot of pertinence nowadays. I first learned about Guantanamo Bay last year in my surveillance class, and since then I've been deeply interested 
        in not only expanding my own knowledge base about it, but also with educating others. I believe that this project helped me accomplish both of these goals, as I ended up
        doing a lot of research on the black site, and I hope that this project proves to be both narratively entertaining and educational for many audiences. I think that
        it's really our duty as people in this country to stay informed about the matters at hand that influence others in this nation, and so this interactive experience
        is truly meant for anyone. This project responds to the issue of why Guantanamo Bay has remained open for so long, despite its very tumultuous history, and questions
        the true intentions of how our current government is using the space.
