        <p class="block index-block text-block" style="font-style: italic; text-indent: 4em;">"Just imagine yourself going to bed, putting all your worries aside, enjoying your favorite magazine to put you to sleep, you’ve put the kids to bed, your family is already sleeping. You are not afraid of being dragged out of your bed in the middle of the night to a place you’ve never seen before, deprived of sleep, and terrorized all the time.</p>
        <p class="block index-block text-block" style="font-style: italic;"> Now imagine that you have no say at all in your life—when you sleep, when you wake up, when you eat, and sometimes when you go to the toilet. Imagine that your whole world comprises, at most, a 6 by 8 foot cell. If you imagine all of that, you still won’t understand what prison really means unless you experience it yourself."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mouhamedou Ould Slahi; engineer, author, and former Guantánamo detainee</p>
        <p class="block index-block text-block">An ergodic dissection of the past, present, and future of Guantánamo Bay, one of America’s most infamous black sites.<br>Established in January 2002 by former President George W. Bush following the 9/11 attacks as a way to hold suspected terrorists and "enemy combatants" during the war on terror. It operates largely outside the jurisdisction of the U.S. federal courts.</p>
        <p class="block index-block text-block">Currently, Guantánamo Bay is being expanded to potentially hold 30,000 migrants, reflecting its past as a holding pen for Haitian refugees. Just as refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. were sent to Guantánamo Bay and subjected to a legal black hole, migrants detained face similar issues.</p>
