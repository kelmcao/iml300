            One day passes, you think it's a nightmare.
            A week passes, and the harsh reality starts to settle in.
            <span style="font-size: 30px;">Weeks continue to fly by,   one   after the   other   , turning into
                months.</span>
            <span style="font-size: 50px;">Months turn into a year, and soon, you celebrate a birthday without
                him.</span>
            <span style="font-size: 70px;">It's been five years since you've seen anything about him.
                You've heard through the news and word of mouth that dozens of men were seized and taken to a base in America,
                but you don't know what's going on there.
                
                You can only hope and pray for his safe return.
