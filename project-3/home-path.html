You decide that maybe today’s not the day for work. Your brother left for his job earlier in the morning anyways, you should keep your parents company, you think. You feel a cough coming, and realize the chill might have just been a cold. You go back upstairs and lie in bed.

Soft.

Warm.

Comfortable.

Loved...
