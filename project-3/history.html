      <h2>A CONTROVERSIAL HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
         This story, though just an example, is not unique. The history of Guantánamo Bay is filled with controversy and
         strife, from the treatment of migrants found at sea, to the false capture of men in the Middle East and the inhumane
         and horrific treatment they faced in Guantánamo Bay. Multiple sources have pointed to bounties given by the U.S. militaries to poorer
         villages in Pakistan and Afghanistan promising large sums of money for turning over "murderers." Many of the men sent to Guantánamo Bay were regular
         citizens, at times even refugees.<br><br></p>

         Guantánamo Bay became synonymous with covert and cruel American operations towards "enemies of the state," who
         received little legal counsel and disappeared without warning for years.
         Certain men were eventually returned home, demonstrating that the unlawful detainment they faced did not
         necesarily prove their guilt. Many men recounted feeling coerced to give
         false confessions just to get a reprieve from the torture <a

            article)</a>.
         Perhaps most pertinent today are the legal rights (or lack thereof) of the prisoners of Guantánamo Bay.<br><br>
         Recently in 2020, a federal appeals court ruled that detainees were not given due process, with an indefinite
         detainee's only constitutional right being to challenge his detention <a

            York Times)</a>.
         Although a larger court granted a rehearing, the issue remains contested and unsolved.<br><br>
