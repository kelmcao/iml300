        You leave home, taking a different route than usual because of some traffic blockade or protest, you’re not sure. You walk
    down
           a
               winding
                        alleyway.
                                 and pass
                                         by a gaggle of men.
                                                      You look down, ignoring them.

                                                       Keep your head down. 
                                                       Don’t look.

You continue walking, when suddenly you hear a boom not too far away. People screaming. You start walking faster. Then <a href="explosion-work.html">running.</a>
