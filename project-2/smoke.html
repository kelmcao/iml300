      <p>While walking to school, you come across a commotion at your neighbor's house.
        The home looks raided, its door hanging loosely by a hinge. Papers are strewn on the ground, trampled and torn up.
        The area's mostly empty save for a few people who toss water
        onto the enflamed area. You're not sure what caused the fire. <br><br>
        On the wall, you can see scratch marks, letters spelling out "PKI."
