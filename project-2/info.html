      <p>On September 30, 1965, the kidnapping and murder of six high ranking generals 
        was orchestrated by Major General Suharto and the Indonesian miltary. They framed 
        the killings on the PKI, or the Communist Party of Indonesia, who was backed by
      President Sukarno. Sukarno was forced to resign due to his failure to control
      the coup, and his presidency was handed to Suharto, who reigned for 31 years.
      Sukarno was placed under house arrest until his death in 1970. <br><br>
      During Suharto's reign, at least 500,000 and potentially over 1,000,000 people were
      murdered. All areas in Indonesia faced the purge of supposed members of the PKI, but
      other minorities including Chinese and Christians were targeted as well, and perhaps
      most devastating was the East Timor occupation and genocide, which left over 100,000
      dead and even more starved.<br><br>
      For decades, the topic of the Indonesian massacre was justified and suppressed, and until
      now no judicial resolution has been given to the victims. The East Timor genocide is still
      denied and argued as an action of "anticolonial unity." <br><br>
      Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Indonesian massacre and its subsequent fallout was heavily
      supported by the United States, who supplied the military with kill lists, propaganda, and
      communication systems, as has recently been discovered in declassified documents.
      This was done ultimately for the goal of eradicating Communist forces and to
      promote pro-Western ideals, however the ruinous effect it had has still not been
      acknowledged.
