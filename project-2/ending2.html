            You walk home after school, and hope that despite the circumstances, things will return to normalcy eventually.
            For now, you have no choice if you want to survive. You watch as your classmates and neighbors
            become increasingly hostile toward one another, joining civilian militaries and baselessly accusing one another
            on nothing more than personal prejudices. "Keep your head down," your mom tells you,
            "and you'll be safe." You can only wish that what she says is true.
            So the days pass, turning into weeks, then months, and <a href="info.html">finally years.</a>
