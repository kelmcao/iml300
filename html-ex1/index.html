    <p id="p1">
      until my hands went soft, still grasping at the air, and </br>
you uprooted stone / you cut down every walnut tree </br>
said: artifact  museum piece  1816,0610.128, our</br>
number slimmed like a fragile moon. its light drew tears </br>
from stone. wind on marble, the sound of my grief.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">Pentelic marble caryatid from the Erechtheion. This is one of six female figures that supported the architrave in the south porch of the Erechtheion.
      The woman wears a peplos pinned on each shoulder. Her hair is braided and falls in a thick rope down her back. She probably held a sacrificial vessel
      in one of the missing hands. The weight she bears is taken on the right leg, hidden by perpendicular folds of the garment. The other leg is bent with
      the drapery clinging to it. The head is surmounted by a capital with a beed and reel and egg and dart moulding. Part of the abacus also survives.
