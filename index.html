      <h3>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h3>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/kelmcao/full/d9fLxy0st">Final: Lorem Ipsum</a>
      <p>
        I always find myself gravitating towards music for inspiration, even when ideating for this project. I wanted to create a musical garden or soundscape of sorts, which the user could display
        in the background while doing any sorts of activities, whether that be creative or otherwise. I wanted the mood to be relaxing, with a multitude of options and vibes to pick from. I focused a
        lot on UI details, such as the fading text on the bottom, and the ease of navigation, zoom, and rotation. I kept relatively simpler navigation systems for this project, but I wanted to allow
        the user free rein to observe the surroundings.<br><br>
        
        I spent a lot of time importing the 3D model, as I was having difficulty with figuring out the material file and texturing. I'm glad I went through this process however, as in the future I know
        how to use WEBGL better. I also spent a lot of time with the pause and unpause feature, as there are several different songs. I ended up changing my code to arrays for words, photos, and sounds,
        which is much more efficient, especially for the pause function.<br><br>

      <h3>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h3>

      <a href="https://kelmcao.github.io/iml300/bali-1965/">Final</a><br />
      <p>
        For my Project 2, I wanted to focus on a significant historical event that I don't believe gets enough attention from US World History courses or in general throughout the western world.
        The Indonesian mass-killings of 1965 and 1966 had a longstanding and significant impact on Indonesian society. President Suharto, the main proponent of the movement called the “New Order”
        ruled as a dictator for 32 years, leading to more than 500,000 deaths, as well as indirectly to the East Timor genocide. I also wanted to touch on ethically contentious American globalization
        and involvement in foreign policy–how imperialist beliefs caused U.S. backed militarization and political turmoil in Indonesia for the purpose of furthering anti-communist goals in one of the
        deadliest massacres of the 20th century. In terms of perspective, I aimed to convey this story through a first-person perspective, so that the player might experience what it may have been like
        as a university student in Bali, one of the regions that was most drastically impacted during that time due to fervent student and civilian militarization. Tensions between neighbors were
        weaponized and turned into reasons to report one another as Communists, and seemingly innocuous interviews conducted by the military masked a much darker reality of imprisonment and extermination.
        Given the serious nature of this topic, I wanted to ensure that the player could have choice in how they interacted with the environment, with two different endings, but also that there would be
        a distance maintained from reality, as this project is just scratching the surface of what happened in those years. I hope to bring more awareness to this genocide, which was recognized by an
        International Tribunal only in 2016, and has not yet been formally reviewed by the United Nations nor officially apologized for by the Indonesian government.<br><br>
