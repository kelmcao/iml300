      <h3>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h3>
      <p>
        I always find myself gravitating towards music for inspiration, even when ideating for this project. I wanted to create a musical garden or soundscape of sorts, which the user could display
        in the background while doing any sorts of activities, whether that be creative or otherwise. I wanted the mood to be relaxing, with a multitude of options and vibes to pick from. I focused a
        lot on UI details, such as the fading text on the bottom, and the ease of navigation, zoom, and rotation. I kept relatively simpler navigation systems for this project, but I wanted to allow
        the user free rein to observe the surroundings.<br><br>
        
        I spent a lot of time importing the 3D model, as I was having difficulty with figuring out the material file and texturing. I'm glad I went through this process however, as in the future I know
        how to use WEBGL better. I also spent a lot of time with the pause and unpause feature, as there are several different songs. I ended up changing my code to arrays for words, photos, and sounds,
        which is much more efficient, especially for the pause function.<br><br>

      <h3>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h3>
        <p>
        For my Project 2, I wanted to focus on a significant historical event that I don't believe gets enough attention from US World History courses or in general throughout the western world.
        The Indonesian mass-killings of 1965 and 1966 had a longstanding and significant impact on Indonesian society. President Suharto, the main proponent of the movement called the “New Order”
        ruled as a dictator for 32 years, leading to more than 500,000 deaths, as well as indirectly to the East Timor genocide. I also wanted to touch on ethically contentious American globalization
        and involvement in foreign policy–how imperialist beliefs caused U.S. backed militarization and political turmoil in Indonesia for the purpose of furthering anti-communist goals in one of the
        deadliest massacres of the 20th century. In terms of perspective, I aimed to convey this story through a first-person perspective, so that the player might experience what it may have been like
        as a university student in Bali, one of the regions that was most drastically impacted during that time due to fervent student and civilian militarization. Tensions between neighbors were
        weaponized and turned into reasons to report one another as Communists, and seemingly innocuous interviews conducted by the military masked a much darker reality of imprisonment and extermination.
        Given the serious nature of this topic, I wanted to ensure that the player could have choice in how they interacted with the environment, with two different endings, but also that there would be
        a distance maintained from reality, as this project is just scratching the surface of what happened in those years. I hope to bring more awareness to this genocide, which was recognized by an
        International Tribunal only in 2016, and has not yet been formally reviewed by the United Nations nor officially apologized for by the Indonesian government.<br><br>

      <h3>Project 3: Networked Care</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to create a project building upon the narrative work I had begun doing in Project 2, and combine it with a historical site that
        still carries a lot of pertinence nowadays. I first learned about Guantánamo Bay last year in my surveillance class, and since then I've been deeply interested 
        in not only expanding my own knowledge base about it, but also with educating others. I believe that this project helped me accomplish both of these goals, as I ended up
        doing a lot of research on the black site, and I hope that this project proves to be both narratively entertaining and educational for many audiences. I think that
        it's really our duty as people in this country to stay informed about the matters at hand that influence others in this nation, and so this interactive experience
        is truly meant for anyone. This project responds to the issue of why Guantánamo Bay has remained open for so long, despite its very tumultuous history, and questions
        the true intentions of how our current government is using the space.

      <h2>Vibe Coding Assignments</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to this semester, I was completely unaware of the existence of vibe-coding, as it is a relatively new progression. I firmly believe that using vibe coding as this semester continued has taught me more about how LLMs like Claude take in and interpret data. For example, while I began the semester through prompting with relatively simple ideas as in my Victorian Joke Website, I now approach software like Claude with a very specific idea and visual style in mind. I would give it specific aesthetics to branch off of and central themes to incorporate. These exercises have also allowed me to observe the ways in which these vibe-coding platforms have grown extremely rapidly. I was really impressed by how the websites that were generated seemed much stronger conceptually at the end of the semester than at the start, showing the quick advancements in technology today.
        <br><br>I do believe though that LLMs are an ethically grey subject. Although they are fascinating tools for experimentation and accessible creation, they do steal many other people’s efforts and hours, condensing and distilling them into the most basic of their parts. So while vibe coding may be able to create a good framework for interactivity, ultimately I believe that it is the people behind the prompt who must then add their own style and flair rather than relying on the simplified skeletons that LLMs create.

        <li><a href="https://v0-victorian-joke-website.vercel.app/">Victorian joke website</a>
        <p>I prompted v0 by Vercel to "make a joke generating website using vocabulary and slang from the Victorian era, and include gothic elements in the design." I wanted to keep it aesthetically pleasing and gothic, with hopefully vintage or lace details. However, I think the AI opted for a more minimalist approach. I do appreciate the color scheme and little emojis it chose to include, though!</p></li>

        <p>
          After reading "What Screens Want" by Frank Chimero, I felt inclined to make a website that logs the number of hours a user has spent on a real-world project, be it personal crafts, business, or school-related. Furthermore, I wanted the website to encourage the user to continue their real-world venture and log off the computer, rather than get their time sucked away by digital distractions. The inspiration for this idea was derived from his focus on the ways in which we can reform the "maps" of the internet into serving our own purposes, especially to do what people already want to do more efficiently and easily. I really liked what he said about how we "can rearrange how we think about the tools we build, so that someone putting down your tool doesn’t disprove its utility, but validates its usefulness."

        <p>
          Inspired by the focus in the lecture video on women in computer science, who are often forgotten or erased from the male-dominated CS history, i vibe-coded this website to display information about Computer Girls, as well as several other notable female figures in computer science. I asked my platform of choice (Replit) to use terminal/command line aesthetics, reflecting the early age of computer science.

        <li><a href="https://performative-authenticity.lovable.app/">authentically yours - Performative Authenticity blog</a>
        <p>
          i created a website inspired by molly soda's color palette as well as her themes of online presence, authenticity, and performance. the blog theme tied into her massive online presence as a micro-celebrity on tumblr, substack, and instagram. i asked lovable to create a website that reflected feminine qualities while playing with kitsch and nostalgic feelings. i wanted the content about the blog posts specifically to be about authenticity, as i thought it would be ironic to see how ai would write about this topic. the outcome for this was super fascinating, as lovable basically recreated a shallow summary of what people often discuss on the topic of performance, and even used modern typing and slang. it was pretty crazy, as it kind of reminded me of the fake positivity posts on instagram which on the surface communicate a deep subject yet ultimately say the same things.

        <li><a href="https://glitch-truth-shaper.lovable.app/">HISTORICAL_ARCHIVE.exe - Corrupted Records</a>
        <p>
          "In Defense of the Poor Image" reminded me greatly of the work of an artist by the name of Stephanie Syjuco--she focuses on the archive and the degradation of images over time due to the lack of resources and importance given to depictions of non-American or marginalized (in America) communities. Much of her work centers around the manipulation of images to re-elevate them to a respected status. For this week's project, I chose to create an archive of sorts of memory, and the manipulation of memory. While researching for Project 2, I looked a lot into American government and CIA/military involvement in foreign issues, as well as the surprising master-narratives that get constructed. While there is no good way for vibe-coding websites to utilize images, I thought that I could instead manipulate words and show the ways in which our understandings of military foreign action have been censored through glitches.

        <li><a href="https://v0-face-analysis-app-ten.vercel.app/">Face Analysis</a>
        <p>
          For this week's vibe code, I was curious about webcams and the inferences that AI might make about people based on their visual impressions. I had to try Claude, Lovable, and finally v0 to land on a result that I felt satisfied with, as the webcam functionality was actually quite difficult to implement. I was inspired by Joy Buolamwini's Ted Talk, in which she discussed the inherent bias found within AI webcams due to the information that is fed to it. I tried to create AI impressions based on the webcam, however it wouldn't work so I instead went with a more randomized approach.

        <li><a href="https://silent-stream-bot.lovable.app/">Ephemeral Chat - Privacy-First AI Chatbot</a>
        <p>
          The concept of being beholden to major tech giants is highlighted in Yaa Addae's "Digital Doulas Take Restorative Justice to Cyberspace" as well as Olivia Ross's "How to Write Non-Violent Creative Code." I think it's humorously ironic how this week's vibe coding exercise touches on these topics while AI is so heavily based on surveillance, sorting, and analysing/emulating humanity, all while expending massive amounts of energy. For example, many AI systems will keep track of former chat messages, building up a database of you as a person. I wanted to see how possible it would be to counteract this by forcing AI to randomly scramble the previous messages immediately after. I wanted to make a privacy-focused chatbot, however I acknowledge that it might never really be possible for me to know whether or not the AI actually scrambled the previous messages.

          I explored Bojana Coklyat and Shannon Finnegan's "Alt-Text as Poetry" for this week. This reading ultimately discusses designing and posting with more awareness of the audience that might not be able to access a piece of work properly, and how to create in a more inclusive manner. "Alt-Text as Poetry" is a website that focuses primarily on educating about the importance of adding Alt-Text to images, a function necessary for the visually impaired that is often cast aside or ignored by both major corporations and individual designers. The website features multiple sections with clickable drop downs elaborating more on the poetic nature that designers can write Alt-Text in while keeping with the goal of accessibility, examples of good Alt-Text, as well as links to many other resources that would be helpful in a designer's journey towards accessibility. I particularly liked the Alt-Text by Sinead Burke at the end of the website. I thought it was very interesting too how the design as a whole of this page was made for user accessibility, from the large fonts to the contrasting colors and usage of Times New Roman.

        <p>
         This week's vibe coding assignment was inspired by "Interview w/ Hamid Khan." By coincidence, I happened to have the issue of data collection and its usage for racial targeting and deportation as one of my ideas for my Networked Care project. I actually talked about Palantir in my own document as well, since they are developing the software "ImmigrationOS" that ICE plans on using to categorize people and predict whether or not they are criminals. This presents MANY ethical issues. I hoped to create a Vibe Coding website that would touch on some of these ethical issues and make people think about the ways in which immigration officers categorize others.
